# RPG Game Database

Welcome to the RPG Game Database project! This project provides a comprehensive solution for managing the data aspects of a role-playing game (RPG), including conceptual, logical, and physical models, along with DDL (Data Definition Language), DML (Data Manipulation Language), and JSON configurations for MongoDB.

## Features

- **Conceptual Model**: Define the high-level concepts and relationships in the RPG game universe.
- **Logical Model**: Translate the conceptual model into a structured representation suitable for implementation.
- **Physical Model**: Implement the logical model into a database schema optimized for performance and scalability.
- **DDL (Data Definition Language)**: Create database objects such as tables, views, indexes, etc., based on the physical model.
- **DML (Data Manipulation Language)**: Perform operations such as inserting, updating, deleting, and querying data in the database.
- **JSON Configuration for MongoDB**: Configure MongoDB collections, documents, indexes, and more using JSON files.
